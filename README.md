# DICTIONARY APP 

I built this pratice project from the ground up using Nextjs / React / Tailwind CSS, as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge.

The app is responsive (mobile / medium+), has both user customisation options (custom font + dark mode), and some quality of life features (such as fallback audio for words that don't contain an audio link). Lastly, I am using the Free Dictionary API to fetch the data.

The reason for picking this project was to practice my Tailwind CSS and getting the responsive elements more in check. I admit some of the code blocks could have been shortened and some more elegant data checks in place, but I went for the faster prototyping approach where needed.

## The challenge

The brief: 'In this project, you'll integrate with the Dictionary API to create a real-world dictionary web app. Additional tests include colour themes and font selection.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.'

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
